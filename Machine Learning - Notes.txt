
Machine Learning : Machine providing results by the help of data sets

	Types of it :-
	
		1. Supervised
		
			-Features & Lables
			-Regression
			-Classification
			
		2. Unsupervised
		
		3. Reinforcemrnt
		
	Linear Regression - min^m distance created from the ploted points on x-y graph (best fit result)

		Linear line : y=mx+c (where m=slope & c=intersect)

	Image Detection
	
		1. Feature Extraction
		2. Create Feature Matrix
		3. Train your data using features and labels
